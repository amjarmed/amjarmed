## 📌 Highlights — Projects & OSS
- **Portfolio (live)** — https://www.amjarmed.com/ — personal site, Next.js, SEO & performance focused.  
- **carePulse** — full-stack demo (see repo).  
- **HORIZON BANK (jsm-banking)** — sample banking UI & patterns.  
- **Aora (React Native)** — mobile app demo.  
- **Postify (Next.js + Sanity)** — headless blog example.  
- **OSS:** `100-nextjs-snippets` (VSCode), `MotionPrime` (CSS animation lib), `loremarabic`, `socialmedia-css-colors`, `Awesome-AnyType-Resources` (80+ ★).  

> **Tip:** Pin 4 repos on your GitHub: `portfolio`, `100-nextjs-snippets`, one production-grade Next.js app, and one mobile app. Pinned repos = immediate credibility.

## ✅ What you’ll find in this account
- Production-ready **Next.js projects** with focus points documented (Lighthouse scores, perf fixes, ISR/SSR decisions).  
- **Case-studies** (architecture decisions, trade-offs, outcomes).  
- CI workflows (lint → typecheck → test → build) + deployment previews (Vercel).  
- OSS tools for dev workflows (snippets, small npm packages).  
- Evidence of discipline: `strict` TypeScript, tests (Vitest), E2E (Playwright) on core apps.

---

## 📈 How I work (short, actionable)
- Start with product constraints → pick SSR/SSG/ISR based on SEO / fresher content.  
- Enforce `strict` TypeScript + linting; PR previews on Vercel for reviews.  
- Measure & optimize: Lighthouse (target ≥90), bundle-splitting, image optimization (`next/image`), route-level code-splitting.  
- Secure-by-default: env management via Vercel, CSP headers, minimal third-party libs.  
- Shipping cadence: small, tested increments + clear changelogs.

---

## 🎯 Current focus
- Move portfolio projects to **Next.js App Router** patterns and add short video case-studies (60–120s).  
- Add Storybook for reusable UI components.  
- Polish one production-grade demo with: Auth (Supabase/NextAuth), Stripe payment flow, and PostHog + Sentry.  
- Prepare German-friendly CV + applications for remote / EU roles.

---

## 📂 Recommended repo README checklist (what to include per project)
- TL;DR (one-line).  
- Live demo URL + screenshots / GIF.  
- Stack & architecture notes (why SSR/ISR, caching strategy).  
- Performance metrics (LCP, TTFB, bundle size) and what you changed.  
- Run / dev steps and CI badge.  
- Tests coverage badge & deployment badge.
